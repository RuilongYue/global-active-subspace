# global-active-subspace
## Introduction
Global active subspace (GAS) method is a generalization of active subspace (AS) method by replacing the matrix C with more "global" information. Theoretical results and experiments show that GAS is better when the test function has uncertainties, or it's discontinuous, and is giving similar results for ordinary cases with AS method.

## Usage
To use the global active subspace method, include the global_as.py and use the function GAS(). It takes the test function, the parameters, and an option of using shifted Sobol' sequence or not as arguments.
